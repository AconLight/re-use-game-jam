**Re-Use** is a fast-paced, time-looping platformer made in 72 hours for the [XYZ Game Jam 2025](https://example.com). Play as **Bit**, a tiny trash robot with a big heart, trying to save a post-apocalyptic city overrun by garbage and corruption. Clean up the world, one loop at a time.

- 🧠 **Puzzle-Platforming** – Solve time-based puzzles by cooperating with your past selves.
- 🗑️ **Eco-Combat** – Fight corrupted trash monsters using recycled gear and clever tactics.
- 🧱 **Pixel-Perfect Art** – Beautifully hand-crafted environments inspired by 90s arcade games.
